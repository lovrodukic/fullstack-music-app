Notes:

Lab B5: The profile view works but the edit button is not fully implemented.

Lab B7: Use http://localhost:3000/login.html?next=./profile/ to test the login
        page. You can the username "test" and password "test" to login as my
        dummy test user. I know the data display looks ugly, but I present a
        proof-of-concept of dynamically loading in user data after
        authentication.
