Notes:

- Use http://localhost:PORT/login.html (username: test, passoword: test) for
  authentication. I don't have a proper view for that set up yet.
    - Note I have also created a user called test2 which showcases the
      functionality of Lab C; that's why the links in this README all refer to
      the user "test2" even though you logged in as "test" user.

- My styling is inconsistent, but all the functionality is there. For the final
  app I will be sure to focus on creating .ts files to handle my styling to make
  everything look finished.

Lab C3: http://localhost:PORT/app/playlist/Test Playlist/test2 to go to the
        playlist view, where you will see a list of three songs.

Lab C4: In the playlist view, you can filter by artist using the input box in
        the top left. For example, searching "Jamiroquai" will only render songs
        by Jamiroquai. Also, you can use http://localhost:PORT/app/profile/test2
        to see test2's information, including their playlists.

Lab C5: Go to http://localhost:PORT/app/profile/test2 and click on "Edit" to
        edit this user's profile information.

To Do:

- Fix all styling.
- Add a "landing page" or login view for /app.
- Refine all the routes and make sure all pages and views are properly
  accessible without having to type full links.
